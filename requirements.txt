# WHIXPI v1.0 - Python Dependencies
# ============================================================
#
# IMPORTANT: Before installing these, you must first install:
#
#   1. PyTorch with CUDA support:
#      pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
#
#   2. WhisperX (from GitHub):
#      pip install git+https://github.com/m-bain/whisperx.git
#
#   These two are NOT listed below because they require special
#   installation commands and cannot be installed via a plain
#   "pip install -r requirements.txt".
#
# After installing PyTorch and WhisperX, run:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
